A mixture of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (0.1 mmol, 0.030 g), H5L (0.04 mmol, 0.018 g), DMA (1.5 mL) and water (1.0 mL) was placed in a screw-capped vial, then the vial was capped and placed in an oven at 105 °C for 72 h. The resulting block crystals were washed with DMA three times to give 1·DMA. The yield was ∼20.6 mg (60.4% based on H5L). Anal. Calcd for C64H85N6O31.5Zn4: C, 45.11; H, 5.03; N, 4.93. Found: C, 45.95; H, 4.88; N, 5.14. IR (cm−1): 3423m, 2964w, 2938w, 2807w, 2487w, 2026w, 1627s, 1506m, 1405s, 1361s, 1261m, 1190w, 1107w, 1020m, 964w, 921w, 891w, 855m, 781s, 724s, 678w, 596w, 478w.
