 A mixture of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (0.1 mmol, 0.030 g), H5L (0.04 mmol, 0.018 g), DMF (1.5 mL) and water (0.5 mL) was placed in a screw-capped vial, then the vial was capped and placed in an oven at 105 °C for 72 h. The resulting block crystals were washed with DMF three times to give 1·DMF, the yield was ∼24.0 mg (72.6% based on H5L). Anal. Calcd for C65H74N7O27.5Zn4: C, 47.17; H, 4.51; N, 5.92. Found: C, 47.02; H, 4.78; N, 5.63.
